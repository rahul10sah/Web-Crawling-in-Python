# Web-Crawling-in-Python
This Python project implements a recursive web crawler with CLI and GUI interfaces built using Tkinter. It authenticates users via hardcoded credentials, crawls pages to a specified depth, extracts JavaScript file URLs using BeautifulSoup, blocks unsafe domains, and logs detailed output.
